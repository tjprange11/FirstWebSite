		<p>The first uniforms of the Royal Navy were issued to commissioned officers only and consisted of a blue dress uniform or 'suit', which featured 'boot cuffs'; based upon formal court wear of the time, and a 'frock', which was a simpler uniform that featured 'mariners cuffs' which were used to turn back the cuffs of the coat when strenuous or dirty work was being done. The frock also featured (unlike the suit which was single-breasted) double breasted lapels that could be worn either buttoned back or worn buttoned across the chest to protect the wearer from the elements.</p>
